# Calendar

Created by Felicia Segerholm, Isabell Betar and Maria Helena Nor√©n.

A calendartool where the user can create, change and delete tasks.
All the tasks and the changes made to the tasks are saved to local storage.

By clicking on a date in the calendar the tasks are filtered and only the tasks for that particular date are shown. The date can be deseleced by clicking on an empty date in the calendar and all of the tasks will be shown.

My areas of responsibilities was creating the calendar and the task icon which indicates the number of tasks on a specific date.
The calendar is setup within a grid system and is dynamically created based on the amount of days within the month and which weekday the first date of the month starts with. Because of this the month can easily be changed and the calendar will stay correct. 

Swedish holidays are also displayed within the calendar, for this we used the [Svenska Helgdagar API](https://api.dryg.net/) (Swedish holiday API).
