# Calendar

Created by Felicia Segerholm, Isabell Betar and Maria Helena Nor√©n.

A calendartool where the user can create, change and delete tasks.
All the tasks and the changes made to the tasks are saved to local storage.

By clicking on a date in the calendar the tasks are filtered and only the tasks for that particular date are shown. The date can be deseleced by clicking on an empty date in the calendar and all of the tasks will be shown.
